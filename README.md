One page business site that contains an image, header and a sign-up form.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. 
Had bit of a challenge to understand how margin and padding changed the sit, when to use what. 
How did you plan? We did a really simple drawing of what the site would look like and what information to ask for.  What technologies did you use? We used different signup forms i.e date, text, email, phone, select and radio buttons.

If you had more time, what would be next? If we have had more time, we would hav added a field for weight of the animal.
